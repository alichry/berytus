An account secured with 2FA typically requires an individual to authenticate using something they know– typically a password–as well as something they have, such as a cell phone or hardware token. Many 2FA methods in widespread use today have not been subjected to adequate usability testing. Furthermore, previous 2FA usability research is difficult to compare due to widely-varying contexts across different studies. We conducted a two-week, between-subjects usability study of five common 2FA methods with 72 participants, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Participants logged into a simulated banking website nearly every day using 2FA and completed an assigned task. Participants generally gave high marks to the methods studied, and many expressed an interest in using 2FA to provide more security for their sensitive online accounts. We also conducted a withinsubjects laboratory study with 30 participants to assess the general usability of the setup procedure for the five methods. While a few participants experienced difficulty setting up a hardware token and a one-time password, in general, users found the methods easy to set up.},

	abstract = {Computer users are asked to generate, keep secret, and recall an increasing number of passwords for uses including host accounts, email servers, e-commerce sites, and online financial services. Unfortunately, the password entropy that users can comfortably memorize seems insufficient to store unique, secure passwords for all these accounts, and it is likely to remain constant as the number of passwords (and the adversary's computational power) increases into the future. In this paper, we propose a technique that uses a strengthened cryptographic hash function to compute secure passwords for arbitrarily many accounts while requiring the user to memorize only a single short password. This mechanism functions entirely on the client; no server-side changes are needed. Unlike previous approaches, our design is both highly resistant to brute force attacks and nearly stateless, allowing users to retrieve their passwords from any location so long as they can execute our program and remember a short secret. This combination of security and convenience will, we believe, entice users to adopt our scheme. We discuss the construction of our algorithm in detail, compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of related approaches, and present Password Multiplier, an implementation in the form of an extension to the Mozilla Firefox web browser.},

	abstract = {A password manager stores and handles users’ passwords from different services. This relieves the users from constantly remembering and recalling many different login credentials. However, because of the poor usability and limited user experience of password managers, users find it difficult to perform basic actions, such as a safe login. Unavoidably, the password manager holds the login credentials of many online services; as a result, it becomes a desired target for online attacks. This results in compromised security, which users often consider as an inevitable condition that must be accepted. Many studies analysed the usability and security of various password managers. Their research findings, though important, are rather incomprehensible to designers of password managers, because they are limited to particular properties or specific applications and they, often, are contradictory. Hence, we focus on investigating properties and features that can elevate the usability, security, and trustworthiness of password managers, aiming at providing practical, simple, and useful guidelines for building a useable password manager. We performed a systematic literature review, in which we selected thirty-two articles with coherent outcomes associated with usability and security. From these outcomes, we deduced and present meaningful suggestions for realising a useable, secure and trustworthy password manager.},

	abstract = {Despite their well-known security problems, passwords are still the incumbent authentication method for virtually all online services. To remedy the situation, users are very often referred to password managers as a solution to the password reuse and weakness problems. However, to date the actual impact of password managers on password strength and reuse has not been studied systematically.We provide the first large-scale study of the password managers' influence on users' real-life passwords. By combining qualitative data on users' password creation and management strategies, collected from 476 participants of an online survey, with quantitative data (incl. password metrics and entry methods) collected in situ with a browser plugin from 170 users, we were able to gain a more complete picture of the factors that influence our participants' password strength and reuse. Our approach allows us to quantify for the first time that password managers indeed influence the password security, however, whether this influence is beneficial or aggravating existing problems depends on the users' strategies and how well the manager supports the users' password management right from the time of password creation. Given our results, we think research should further investigate how managers can better support users' password strategies in order to improve password security as well as stop aggravating the existing problems.},

Instead of remembering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better remember their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts.

Relatedly, even though there is a large body of research on improving passwords, the massive number of application verification services that use passwords stymie the diffusion of improvements—i.e., it does not scale for each improvement to require an update to every application and verification service.To address these problems, we propose a new end-to-end password paradigm that transfers password functionality to two end-points, the operating system (entry, management, storage, and verification) and the password verification service (verification, and verification token storage). In this paradigm, passwords are never shared with applications or transmitted over the network, but are instead verified using zero-knowledge protocols. There are five key benefits of this approach that are not possible with the current password paradigm: (a) a minimal attack surface, (b) protection from password phishing, (c) protection from malware, (d) consistent password policies, and (e) the ability to more rapidly diffuse improvements from password research.},

We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants.},

	abstract = {Single Sign-On ({SSO}) protocols like {OAuth} 2.0 and {OpenID} Connect 1.0 are cornerstones of modern web security, and have received much academic attention. Users sign in at a trusted Identity Provider ({IdP}) that subsequently allows many Service Providers ({SPs}) to verify the users' identities. Previous research concentrated on the standardized - called textbook {SSO} in this paper - authentication flows, which rely on {HTTP} redirects to transfer identity tokens between the {SP} and {IdP}. However, modern web applications like single page apps may not be able to execute the textbook flow because they lose the local state in case of {HTTP} redirects. By using novel browser technologies, such as {postMessage}, developers designed and implemented {SSO} protocols that were neither documented nor analyzed thoroughly. We call them dual-window {SSO} flows. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of dual-window {SSO} flows. In particular, we focus on the In-Browser Communication ({InBC}) used to exchange authentication tokens between {SPs} and {IdPs} in iframes and popups. We automate our analysis by developing Distinct - a tool that dynamically analyzes the {JavaScript} code executing as part of the {SSO} flow. Distinct translates the flow into a sequence diagram depicting all communicating entities and their exchanged messages, highlights insecure communication channels, and quantifies novel threats in dual-window {SSO} flows. We found that 56\% of the {SPs} in the Tranco top 1k list support dual-window {SSO}. Surprisingly, 28\% of the {SPs} implemented dual-window {SSO} without using official {SDKs}, leading to identity theft and {XSS} in 31\% of these self-implemented {SPs}.},

To address this knowledge gap, we conduct observational interviews with 32 password manager users. Using grounded theory, we identify four theories describing the processes and rationale behind participants’ usage of password managers. We find that many users simultaneously use both a browser-based and a third-party manager, using each as a backup for the other, with this new paradigm having intriguing usability and security implications. Users also eschew generated passwords because these passwords are challenging to enter and remember when the manager is unavailable, necessitating new generators that create easy-to-enter and remember passwords. Additionally, the credential audits provided by most managers overwhelm users, limiting their utility and indicating a need for more proactive and streamlined notification systems. We also discuss mobile usage, adoption and promotion, and other related topics.},

Understanding why some choose to use password managers while others do not is important towards generally understanding why some users do what they do and, by extension, designing motivational tools such as video tutorials to help motivate more to use password managers. To investigate differences between those who do and do not use a password manager, for this paper, we distributed an online survey to a total of 137 users and 111 non-users of the tool that asked about their opinions/experiences with password managers. Furthermore, since emotion has been identified by work in psychology and communications as influential in other risk-laden decision-making (e.g., safe-sex behavior such as condom use), we asked participants who use a password manager to rate how they feel for 45 different emotions, or, as the case for those who do not use a password manager, to rate how they imagine they would feel the 45 emotions if they did use the tool. Our results show that "users" of password managers noted convenience and usefulness as the main reasons behind using the tool, rather than security gains, underscoring the fact that even a large portion of users of the tool are not considering security as the primary benefit while making the decision. On the other hand, "non-users" noted security concerns as the main reason for not using a password manager, highlighting the prevalence of suspicion arising from lack of understanding of the technology itself. Finally, analysis of the differences in emotions between "users" and "non-users" reveals that participants who never use a password manager are more likely to feel suspicious compared to "users," which could be due to misunderstandings about the tool.},

Instead of remembering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better remember their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts.

Our attacks are severe: in four out of the five password managers we studied, an attacker can learn a user's credentials for arbitrary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared passwords. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also diverse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in addition to the typical vulnerabilities like {CSRF} and {XSS}. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure. To guide future development of password managers, we provide guidance for password managers.

To understand the underlying reasons, we conducted the first empirical usability study of mobile {PMs}, covering both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

	abstract = {Passwords are widely used for user authentication, but they are often difficult for a user to recall, easily cracked by automated programs, and heavily reused. Security questions are also used for secondary authentication. They are more memorable than passwords, because the question serves as a hint to the user, but they are very easily guessed. We propose a new authentication mechanism, called “life-experience passwords ({LEPs}).” Sitting somewhere between passwords and security questions, an {LEP} consists of several facts about a user-chosen life event—such as a trip, a graduation, a wedding, and so on. At {LEP} creation, the system extracts these facts from the user’s input and transforms them into questions and answers. At authentication, the system prompts the user with questions and matches the answers with the stored ones. We show that question choice and design make {LEPs} much more secure than security questions and passwords, while the question-answer format promotes low password reuse and high recall.Specifically, we find that: (1) {LEPs} are 109–1014 × stronger than an ideal, randomized, eight-character password; (2) {LEPs} are up to 3 × more memorable than passwords and on par with security questions; and (3) {LEPs} are reused half as often as passwords. While both {LEPs} and security questions use personal experiences for authentication, {LEPs} use several questions that are closely tailored to each user. This increases {LEP} security against guessing attacks. In our evaluation, only 0.7\% of {LEPs} were guessed by casual friends, and 9.5\% by family members or close friends—roughly half of the security question guessing rate. On the downside, {LEPs} take around 5 × longer to input than passwords. So, these qualities make {LEPs} suitable for multi-factor authentication at high-value servers, such as financial or sensitive work servers, where stronger authentication strength is needed.},

We identify three distinct threat models that can be used to analyze web applications, ranging from a web attacker who controls malicious web sites and clients, to stronger attackers who can control the network and/or leverage sites designed to display user-supplied content. We propose two broadly applicable security goals and study five security mechanisms. In our case studies, which include {HTML}5 forms, Referer validation, and a single sign-on solution, we use a {SAT}-based model-checking tool to find two previously known vulnerabilities and three new vulnerabilities. Our case study of a Kerberos-based single sign-on system illustrates the differences between a secure network protocol using custom client software and a similar but vulnerable web protocol that uses cookies, redirects, and embedded links instead.},

	abstract = {We evaluate two decades of proposals to replace text passwords for general-purpose user authentication on the web using a broad set of twenty-five usability, deployability and security benefits that an ideal scheme might provide. The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, ardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes ffering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

This web-based single sign-on ({SSO}) scheme is enabled by {OAuth} 2.0, a web resource authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service providers. The {OAuth} 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open question. We examine the implementations of three major {OAuth} identity providers ({IdP}) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular {RP} websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim user's profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the {RP} website. Closer examination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementation simplicity. To improve the security of {OAuth} 2.0 {SSO} systems in real-world settings, we suggest simple and practical improvements to the design and implementation of {IdPs} and {RPs} that can be adopted gradually by individual sites.},

	abstract = {With the boom of software-as-a-service and social networking, web-based single sign-on ({SSO}) schemes are being deployed by more and more commercial websites to safeguard many web resources. Despite prior research in formal verification, little has been done to analyze the security quality of {SSO} schemes that are commercially deployed in the real world. Such an analysis faces unique technical challenges, including lack of access to well-documented protocols and code, and the complexity brought in by the rich browser elements (script, Flash, etc.). In this paper, we report the first "field study" on popular web {SSO} systems. In every studied case, we focused on the actual web traffic going through the browser, and used an algorithm to recover important semantic information and identify potential exploit opportunities. Such opportunities guided us to the discoveries of real flaws. In this study, we discovered 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile {ID} providers and relying party websites, such as Open {ID} (including Google {ID} and Pay Pal Access), Face book, Jan Rain, Freelancer, Farm Ville, Sears.com, etc. Every flaw allows an attacker to sign in as the victim user. We reported our findings to affected companies, and received their acknowledgements in various ways. All the reported flaws, except those discovered very recently, have been fixed. This study shows that the overall security quality of {SSO} deployments seems worrisome. We hope that the {SSO} community conducts a study similar to ours, but in a larger scale, to better understand to what extent {SSO} is insecurely deployed and how to respond to the situation.},

The framework defines quality criteria which are quantified according to two principles: participation and categorization. Building on previous works we focus on usability perspectives in more detail.

In contrast to desktop systems where password managers receive no system-level support, mobile operating systems provide autofill frameworks designed to integrate with password managers to provide secure and usable autofill for browsers and other apps installed on mobile devices. In this paper, we evaluate mobile autofill frameworks on {iOS} and Android, examining whether they achieve substantive benefits over the ad-hoc desktop environment or become a problematic single point of failure. Our results find that while the frameworks address several common issues, they also enforce insecure behavior and fail to provide password managers sufficient information to override the frameworks’ insecure behavior, resulting in mobile managers being less secure than their desktop counterparts overall. We also demonstrate how these frameworks act as a confused deputy in manager-assisted credential phishing attacks. Our results demonstrate the need for significant improvements to mobile autofill frameworks.

To aid in designing such usability studies, we systematize password manager use cases, identifying ten essential use cases, three recommended use cases, and four extended use cases. We also systematize the system designs employed to satisfy these use cases, designs that should be examined in usability studies to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we describe observations from 136 cognitive walkthroughs exploring the identified essential use cases in eight popular managers. Ultimately, we expect that this work will serve as the foundation for an explosion of new research into the usability of password managers.},

In this paper, we present {ByPass}, a novel password manager that is placed between the user and the website for secure and direct communication between the manager and websites. This direct communication allows {ByPass} to minimize the users' actions needed to complete various password management tasks, including account registration, logins, and password changes. {ByPass} is designed to minimize errors and improve usability. We conducted a usability evaluation of {ByPass} and found that this approach shows promising usability, and can help users to better manage their accounts in a secure manner.},

/*
 * Goal: define an e2ee midleware such that:
 * - it decrypts incoming payloads to match their cleartext
 *   counterpart's datatype. Fortunately, the current
 *   implementation employ a uniform payload format for
 *   both cleartext and ciphertext payloads. Previously,
 *   when e2ee is disabled, the public key in the SelectKey
 *   message is sent by the web app as a base64-encoded string,
 *   but when e2ee is enabled, the web app sends an encrypted
 *   payload that decrypts to the raw bytes of the public key.
 *   Hence, if somehow the implementation is modified to alllow
 *   cleartext payload formats that are different from that of
 *   the plaintext, this middleware must handle it to ensure
 *   uniformity.
 * - it encrypts outgoing payloads, ensuring the ciphertext
 *   corresponds to what the secret manager expects; e.g.,
 *   don't encrypt base64 encoding of a signed nonce, encrypt
 *   the raw bytes.
 *
 * For both of these operations, the middleware should be
 * intuitive enough to infer the channel and retrieve the
 * shared secret (if any). If e2ee is disabled, i.e. no shared
 * key, the middleware leaves the payload intact.
